# gauss1181.github.io

My personal website, including a portfolio of my past software projects.

Initially made in January 2015. 

As of 6/5/2015: Currently under construction for adding some recent projects from 2015, as well as revamping and reformatting the site's HTML/CSS styling. Stay tuned for updates! :)
